The resulting dataset is published on this website for free download by scholars around the world. The current dataset covers 1,800 villages and was uploaded in February 2022. The project will continue extracting data from more gazetteers as time and resources allow with the goal of eventually reaching 2,500–3,000 village gazetteers.

The USC Digital Library has digitized most of the items in these collections and made them available to the public. However, they are scattered across various collections and are difficult for researchers to track and discover. Furthermore, since many of these archival materials were given to USC by lesser-known donors and families, their research value may be overlooked by faculty, students, and scholars at USC and around the world.

READCHINA: The Politics of Reading in the People's Republic of China,,modern,China,University of Freiburg,University of Freiburg,English,"curated collection,research project,network analysis,archive,database",https://readchina.github.io//,open access,"READCHINA investigates the politics and practices of reading in the People’s Republic of China (PRC), their interpretation and their impact on social and intellectual change. The main objective of the study is a reinvestigation of literary history and cultural policy of the PRC from the perspective of the ordinary reader. This grassroots approach means turning away from the established focus on authors and the political context. Instead, READCHINA will investigate the social conditions under which texts were read, what influences this had on the lives of individuals, on social, intellectual and literary change in China, and on the modes of production, distribution and consumption of literature.

READCHINA considers the reading of literature as part of a wider web of reading materials, including different media and non-fictional texts. Primary sources will consist among others of archival material, field work interviews, autobiographies, marketing materials, statements by fans in online forums, and literary texts. Combining literary analysis with historical and ethnographical inquiry, as well as methods from the digital humanities, READCHINA will contribute to the fields of literary history and literary sociology. Moreover, in combining close readings of texts with distant reading methods, READCHINA will also foster our understanding of the meaning and impact of popular literature in China and of literary theories on reading and thus also bring 20th and 21st century China into the global history of reading.",12/14/2023 2:19pm,

Boorman in 1967-1971 (Columbia University Press). The BDRC was a reference work that generations of historians used in their research and teaching. It provided essential information on both a large group of Chinese elites (including one foreigner) and on the history of the period. The BDRC went out of print decades ago and became inaccessible, except in libraries ((The print version of the BDRC is now out of print, but the four main volumes are available for consultation — on loan — at Archives.org.)). It also became obsolete due to its use of the Wade-Giles transliteration system, the availability of new materials (especially in Chinese), and of course the rise of Wikipedia-type platforms in the United States and in China. Yet the BDRC remains a very valuable piece of scholarship that we sought to transform to make it available again under new guise to the public.",12/14/2023 2:19pm,
